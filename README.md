# Jon's Workbench

This repository holds a bunch of random code that is:

  - worth keeping as it has some form of educational/historical value; but
  - not significant enough for a repository of its own.

This is my chaotic playground for tiny experiments and proof-of-concepts.

Bugs are guaranteed, documentation is improbable, and quality is unlikely. Don't
expect much. However, if you find something here that interests you or that you
want to talk about, feel free to [get in touch](https://jonpalmisc.com/contact).
