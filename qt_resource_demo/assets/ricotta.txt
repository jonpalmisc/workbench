Ricotta is an Italian whey cheese made from sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water
buffalo milk whey left over from the production of other cheeses. Like other
whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the
casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin.

Ricotta (literally meaning "recooked", "refined") protein can be harvested if
the whey is first allowed to become more acidic by additional fermentation
(by letting it sit for 12â€“24 hours at room temperature). Then the acidified
whey is heated to near boiling. The combination of low pH and high temperature
denatures the protein and causes it to flocculate, forming a fine curd. Once
cooled, it is separated by passing the liquid through a fine cloth, leaving the
curd behind.

Ricotta curds are creamy white in appearance, and slightly sweet in taste. The
fat content changes depending on the milk used. In this form, it is somewhat
similar in texture to some fresh cheese variants, though considerably lighter.
It is highly perishable. However, ricotta is also made in aged varieties which
are preservable for much longer.
